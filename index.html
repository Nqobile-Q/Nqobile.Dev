        <h1>Hello! I am <span>Nqobile</span>, a Front-End Web Developer</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I build responsive and modern websites.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, I am Nqobile Kolobe, a self-taught front-end web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and responsive websites. I believe that every line of code has the power to tell a story, solve a problem, and make someone’s life easier.
        I am constantly learning and growing, exploring new technologies, and challenging myself to improve with every project. What drives me is not just building websites, but building experiences that connect people, inspire creativity, and bring ideas to life.
        When I am not coding, you will find me experimenting with new designs, finding inspiration in everyday life, or learning something new to expand my skills. I’m excited to collaborate, create, and make a meaningful impact through the work I do.
        Let us build something amazing together.</p>
